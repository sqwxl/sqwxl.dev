I went through a drawn out phase in my twenties in which I was very depressed. It was an existential crisis in many ways. In an effort to heal, I got really into spiritual teachings of various stripes. I hoped I could find solace and perhaps some clearer insight into what the hell was going on. I was also really skeptical of organized religions and cults and so never engaged in anything formal for too long, never had a teacher, I just tried all kinds of different approaches, mostly meditation. I floundered.

Despite my best efforts, I never got anywhere substantial and none of the techniques I put into practice ever gave me any sense of making progress or achieving any sort of insight or peace or anything. Importantly, none of it ever helped me with my depression; if anything it made it worse.

At some point, following an acquaintance's glowing recommendation, I even went on a 10 day silent retreat at a meditation center where I diligently practiced from morning to evening with about 11 hours of formal sitting meditation every day. Even that intense experience failed to produce anything noteworthy for me. I was pretty disillusioned with mediation at this point. That was about 8 years ago or more.

In the interim I have had a few other short periods where I did daily meditation; I guess despair drove me to it again and again despite the fact that it didn't seem to help. Despair, and a profound and seemingly unshakable fascination with the enlightenment discourse. The claims to insight made by so-called Buddhas, Zen masters, mystics of all stripes and the like seem so similar across time, space and socio-cultural contexts that I can't help concluding there must be _something_ there.

I don't know what that insight is, or what it might look or feel like. To be honest, I don't fully trust it's actually possible. But I've been fascinated with this stuff since childhood and I've felt for about just as long that there's just got to be something "more" to life. Something feels "off", "missing", or "not quite right" and when I read these sorts of texts with their promises of "Truth", "primordial awareness" or whatever, it resonates with me on a profound level.
Maybe it's a wild goose chase. Maybe there's just nothing to be gained but a bunch of wacky experiences. (There's a famous quote from the Buddha where he asserts to have truly gained nothing from enlightenment). Yet, my curiosity has kept me coming back. And every time it's been the same; I've banged my head against the wall to no avail at all; or so it's seemed to me. Eventually, I just gave up. I put all this stuff out of my mind and went on with my life. I thought I was done with this.

Enter Daniel Ingram who I recently discovered in a podcast [interview](https://revolutionaryleftradio.libsyn.com/ingram). Daniel is an American emergency room doctor who claims to have achieved spiritual enlightenment by following precise meditative practices based in the Theravada Buddhist tradition. He's written a book: _Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha: An Unusually Hardcore Dharma Book_ (MCTB) in which he lays out a pragmatic distillation of various Buddhist practices and roadmaps on the path to enlightenment. Against my better judgment, my interest was piqued. Daniel has a very down-to-earth, results-oriented approach which immediately appealed to me. It seemed this might be exactly the sort of book I wish I had had in those harrowing periods in my twenties.

I started reading MCTB (available free [here](https://www.mctb.org)) and it's been thoroughly engrossing so far. And with this newfound interest, I began meditating again...

Following some directions in MCTB I chose to begin with daily breath concentration meditation and this put me face to face with my old problem describe above. Namely, that meditation doesn't seem to "do" much of anything for me.

Putting this in perspective with my recent diagnosis of being on the autistic spectrum. I began to wonder if there might be something about my neurodivergent brain that could explain my difficulties.

For one thing, I'm an **extremely** intellectual person. I don't mean that in the sense that I'm a bookworm, or that I like to philosophize all the time. What I mean is that on very basic experiential level, I am nearly always "in my head". From what I understand, developing concentration and insight in meditation has a lot to do with connecting with bare sensory input; and this is something that just doesn't come naturally to me. I live and breath in a world of concepts and ideas; sensations are always distant and peripheral, almost alien. And don't get me started with emotions...

There's definitely a strong intellectual component to the world of meditation -- and Buddhism especially -- in the form of seemingly innumerable frameworks, concepts and philosophical systems built to help navigate the spiritual realm. Setting that aside, pretty much all the practical advice I've ever seen seems to point back towards a focus on ordinary experiential reality, rather than cognitive understanding. Hence my difficulty.

It's not quite that I can't focus on sensations without intellectualizing them, it's just that I don't know what to do with these sensations when I have them in my sight. They just seem to come up and fade at random, like raindrops on a windshield. But I fail to engage or feel much curiosity or genuine interest. It's like "OK, but what now? Where's the puzzle for me to solve? What's there to understand here? This is boring!"

Without that genuine interest and curiosity, the whole process quickly becomes very labored and tedious.

I realize this isn't unique to me, but I do feel I'm facing a higher barrier-to-entry than most. I think. 

Maybe I need to learn to relax before I can actually see some benefits of meditation. It's not easy! And to be honest, I'm not interested in meditating in order to become more relaxed or to have pleasurable experiences (although if that happens, I won't complain).  But I am interested in gaining insight into the nature of reality. Experiential reality, at any rate.  That said, I'm beginning to think it might be worthwhile to study try out some relaxation techniques if this is part of what's holding me back.

There are also all kinds of relaxation and meditation techniques out there, and I definitely should do some more experimenting. It's possible I just haven't yet found a method that works for me.

I can't say I have a die-hard conviction about any of this stuff. I'm just really curious and hopeful; and sick of feeling dissatisfied, detached, numb, jaded, depressed, cynical, etc. So I'll give this stuff my best shot. I don't have much to lose anyway, and I have the luxury of free time so why not!
